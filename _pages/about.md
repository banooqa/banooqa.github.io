I am a Doctoral Research Assistant at Texas State University, where I conduct cutting-edge research on Generative Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance Computing (HPC). My research focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to solve HPC problems. I have also gained valuable experience as a Summer Intern at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where I worked on a project that involved applying deep learning techniques to analyze and generate scientific data. I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies that can enhance my research and career.
